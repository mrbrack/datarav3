          <p>
            I use creative programming to create art, websites and live
            experiences. I also facilitate workshops covering the topics of
            ethics, future technologies, website development and AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            I owe much of what I do to being surrounded by fine artists on an
            almost daily basis. A core part of my practice involves
            collaborating with them to bring their ideas to life using creative
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            My own artworks find their roots in: the spectacle, environmental
            concern, ethics, nostalgic technologies and electronic music. From
            time to time I enjoy sneaking my work into fine art environments.
